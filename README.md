# Installing
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/iUltimateLP/NXGallery/releases) and drag the `NXGallery.nro` file to the `switch/` folder of your SD card. You can also drag the file to your Switch via [ftpd](https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd). 

NXGallery was tested working on [AtmosphÃ¨re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) 0.12.0 and firmware version 10.0.2, but should work above/below, if you know what you're doing.

# Building
Compiling this project requires a [Nintendo Switch Homebrew dev environment](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment) to be installed. Then, install the following dependencies (required for [borealis](https://github.com/natinusala/borealis)):
```
(sudo) (dkp-)pacman -S switch-glfw switch-mesa switch-glm
```
After that, clone this repo and run `make all` in the root of this repo. You will find all compiled files in the `out/` folder.
