    ðŸŽ® A Nintendo Switch Homebrew Application to transfer your screenshots to your phone in no-time ðŸ“±âš¡
</p>

# What is it?
 + Simplifies the process of exchanging your console's gallery with your smartphone
 + Allows easy and quick sharing of screenshots with your friends
 + Needs Homebrew (CFW) installed on your Switch

# Installing
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/iUltimateLP/NXGallery/releases) and extract the .zip archive to the root of your SD card. You can also drag the files to your Switch via [ftpd](https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd). 

NXGallery was tested working on [AtmosphÃ¨re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) 0.10.4, but should work above/below, if you know what you're doing.

# Building
Compiling this project requires a [Nintendo Switch Homebrew dev environment](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment) to be installed. After that, clone this repo and run `make all` in the root of this repo. You will find all compiled files in the `out/` folder.

# Credits
I've used the following libraries, without this project wouldn't have been possible:
 + [libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx)
 + [AtmosphÃ¨re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)
 + [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
