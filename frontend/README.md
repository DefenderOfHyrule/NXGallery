    üéÆ A Nintendo Switch Homebrew Application to transfer your screenshots to your phone in no-time üì±‚ö°

# `frontend/`
This is the frontend code - it's the web page you'll see when opening NXGallery on your phone or on your computer. It utilizes [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) ‚ù§Ô∏è

# Developing
To develop this frontend, you'll need to have the server active on the Switch - so just start NXGallery on your Switch and leave it open. Next, you need to tell the frontend where to find your Switch (and it's NXGallery server when developing). To do that, open up `index.js` and see the following lines:

```js
// Set the IP of your switch so it can connect in dev mode
const DEV_IP = "http://192.168.178.46:1234";
```

Replace the IP address here with the address of your Switch. Then, open up a command prompt and type:

```sh
$ cd frontend/
$ npm install
$ make dev
```

That will spawn the React development server and open up the page in your web browser. It should connect to the NXGallery server running on your Switch and you should be able to develop the frontend.

# Building
To build the frontend, simply type in a command prompt:

```sh
$ cd frontend/
$ make build
```

That will automatically build the frontend and copy it in the app's [romfs](https://github.com/iUltimateLP/NXGallery/tree/master/app/romfs/www) - so you can then just build the app and you're done.
